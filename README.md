# iDeclareWar

I Declare War is a popular card game.

This game was created in Swift on iOS 13. After splitting the deck evenly between players, players choose the card from the top of the deck and the high card wins. If there is a draw players select the top 4 cards from the deck saying I De-Clare War. Whoever has the highest 4th card wins that round. This process can be repeated until the round has a winner. The winner is the player that holds the entire deck at the end.

A player is able to play against the cpu in this iOS version of the game. The game can run on macOS using Xcode or on an Iphone or iPad
